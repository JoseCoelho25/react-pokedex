# React-Pokedex  

I took the idea for this project from my React lessons and decided to do it using PokeAPI!

The project consists of a responsive site using react, and tailwind for the design with the following:

- Display of 152 pokemon using PokeAPI request
- Dynamic page routing using react-router-dom
- Dynamic details page with pokemon attributes, sprite, gender and many more curious facts
- Bg color dynamic and diferent for each type of pokemon the user chooses
- Navbar animations using GSAP.
- Loading screen with GSAP animation while requesting data from API
- Form with validations.
- About page with contact info to me :)
- Responsiveness
